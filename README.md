### by Jake Blackburn

## Summary 

This project is a simple but fully functioning e-commerce application where users can "buy" famous artworks from distinguished artists of history. It is made with Vue.js and an API served via Firebase cloud functions, built with aMongoDB Atlas database served with Express.

The Frontend is Mostly from circa Fall 2022, and was recently revamped and retrofitted for Google's Firebase.


## Usage

To run the project locally, clone the repo and perform the following commands in a terminal emulator / CLI:

First, install dependencies with:

'npm install'

(you will need to have npm and node installed to begin with)

Then you can serve up the app with:

'npm run serve'

If all goes according to plan, the site should be available at localhost:8080.
